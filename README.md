Steam Web API
=============

A wrapper library that allows you to send requests to Steam Web API implemented in PHP language


## Installation

You can easily install this package via Composer:

* Add `"epigra/steam-web-api": "1.0.0"` to your `composer.json` file.

```
{
    "require": {
		"epigra/steam-web-api": "1.0.0"
	}
}
```

* Type `composer update` on Terminal

* Ready to use!


##Â Usage

* Add the following namespace to your file

```php
use Epigra\SteamWebApi\Api\AbstractSteamAPI;
```

* Then, you need to initialize client with your Steam Web API credentials

```php  
AbstractSteamAPI::init('http://api.steampowered.com', 'YOUR_API_KEY', 'YOUR_RESPONSE_FORMAT');
```
Note : Response format can be either json or xml.

* Once you initialize, select your API module and then call the appropriate method.

Let say we would like to get player items, then following code block will be fine for that purpose

```php
$appID = ApplicationIDs::TeamFortress2;
$steamID = 76561197962033671;
$response = IEconItemsAPI::getPlayerItems($appID, $steamID);
var_dump($response);
```
