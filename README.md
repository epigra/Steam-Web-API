Steam Web API
=============

A wrapper library that allows you to send requests to Steam Web API implemented in PHP Laravel Framework.

This library simply takes arguments from method call and uses `GuzzleHttp` to send request Steam Web API and returns the response as expected.

It's thin client and usable for every game in Steam.

## Installation

You can easily install this package via Composer:

* Add `"epigra/steam-web-api": "1.0.0"` to your `composer.json` file.

```
{
    "require": {
		"epigra/steam-web-api": "1.0.0"
	}
}
```

* Type `composer update` on Terminal

* Ready to use!


##Â Usage

* Add the following namespace to your file

```php
use Epigra\SteamWebApi\Api\AbstractSteamAPI;
```

* Then, you need to initialize client with your Steam Web API credentials

```php  
AbstractSteamAPI::init('http://api.steampowered.com', 'YOUR_API_KEY', 'YOUR_RESPONSE_FORMAT');
```
Note : Response format can be either json or xml.

* Once you initialize, select your API module and then call the appropriate method.

Let say we would like to get player items, then following code block will be fine for that purpose

```php
$appID = ApplicationIDs::TeamFortress2;
$steamID = 76561197962033671;
$response = IEconItemsAPI::getPlayerItems($appID, $steamID);
var_dump($response);
```

## More Info About Library
 
* As you may know, there are some modules of Steam Web API. These are all available in this library. 
 
Here is the list of class names and their namespaces that you can use.
